twopence-rpc
===========

Scripts for testing libtirpc, rpcbind and utilities with twopence.


twopence/
	This directory contains the scripts needed to run these
	tests under twopence

src/
	This contains the C utilities that come with this test
	suite.


The "square" client and server
==============================

This one uses the server to compute the square of a number. You can
use this to write scripted test scenarios. There's not much variety
in this, yet, but more functionality can be added if needed.


The "rpctest" libtirpc unit tests
=================================

The other C utility is a program to unit test libtirpc. Simply invoke as
./rpctest and it will run through about 100 different test cases,
exercising a fairly large number of common tirpc interfaces. I'm still
working on this part, so more functionality should be added soon.

The rpctest tool can be run both as root user, and as normal user - and
both should actually be attempted for verification, because when run
as root, it will try to do a few more things than as a normal user.

When you run this on older versions of libtirpc, you will see it crash,
or print messages about certain test cases crashing (the code tries to
catch some well-known crashes gracefully). Fixes for these are available
from https://gitorious.org/libtirpc/libtirpc/commits/for-upstream

rpctest understands the following options:

 -D
 	run disputed test cases. Currently, this mostly covers
	tests that check behavior of rpcbind versus registrations
	of privileged ports when the user is not root. Several
	developers believe that the notion of privileged ports
	should not be honored by rpcbind.

 -q
 	run more quietly. By default, rpctest will print a message
	regarding each test case it executes. By specifying -q,
	only failing test cases will be printed.

 -h hostname
 	This doesn't do anything useful yet

Enjoy
