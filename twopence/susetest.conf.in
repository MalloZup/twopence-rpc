# Sample config file for this twopence test
# (not standardized yet)
#
# I hope that we will get a wrapper script that parses this
# and makes sure we allocate the right nodes and install the
# right packages on them
#

# First off, we need a client
# We want the following packages to be installed:
# rpcbind	for rpcinfo
# tunctl	for /sbin/tunctl
#
node		client
attr packages	rpcbind tunctl

# We also need a server
# We want the following packages to be installed:
# rpcbind	for /sbin/rpcbind and its systemd unit files
node		server
attr packages	rpcbind
